## 🔁 Process of Back-Merge (Systematic)

### 🧩 Definition
The **back-merge process** is the practice of merging changes **from a stable branch (e.g., `main`) back into the development branch (e.g., `develop`)**.  
It ensures that bug fixes or updates applied in production are also available in ongoing development.

---

### ⚙️ When It Happens
In the **Git Flow** model:

- After completing a **hotfix** or **release**, the branch is merged into `main` (for production).  
- To keep development synchronized, the same changes must be **merged back into `develop`**.  

This backflow keeps both branches aligned and prevents reintroducing bugs.

---

### 🪜 Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Finish the hotfix or release
git flow hotfix finish fix-login-bug
# or
git flow release finish v1.0.1

# 2. Ensure develop includes those fixes
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

---

### 🎯 Purpose
- Keep `develop` up to date with all production fixes.  
- Maintain a consistent project history.  
- Avoid missing patches in future releases.  
- Ensure smooth transitions between release cycles.

---

### ⚠️ If You Skip Back-Merge
- Fixes made in production may be **lost** in future versions.  
- `develop` may become **out of sync** with `main`.  
- The same bugs might **reappear** in later releases.
