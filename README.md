# 🚀 The `release` Branch in Git Flow

## Overview

In the **Git Flow** model, the `release` branch is used to **prepare a new production release**.  
It allows developers to finalize, test, and polish the upcoming version without blocking ongoing work in the `develop` branch.

---

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **Created from:** `develop`  
- **Merged into:** `main` and `develop`  
- **Purpose:** To stabilize the code, perform testing, and fix minor bugs before release  
- **Naming convention:** `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/1.0`, `release/2.1`)  
- **Includes:** Final adjustments like documentation updates, version number changes, and small fixes  
- **Temporary branch:** Deleted after the release is finished  

---

## 🧭 Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a new release branch from develop
git flow release start 1.0

# (Optional) Publish the release branch to remote
git flow release publish 1.0

# Make final changes (update version, fix bugs, etc.)
git commit -am "Update version number and finalize release"

# Finish the release
git flow release finish 1.0
```

### Explanation of Commands

- `git flow release start <version>` → Creates a branch `release/<version>` from `develop`.  
- `git flow release publish <version>` → Pushes the release branch to the remote repository for collaboration.  
- `git flow release finish <version>` →  
  - Merges the release branch into both `main` and `develop`.  
  - Tags the commit with the release version (e.g., `v1.0`).  
  - Deletes the release branch locally.

The `release` branch provides a clean environment to finalize and verify a version before deployment, keeping `develop` open for new work while ensuring `main` remains stable and production-ready.
