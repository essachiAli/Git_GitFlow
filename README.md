# 🧩 The `develop` Branch in Git Flow

## Overview

The `develop` branch is the **main integration branch** in the Git Flow model.  
It serves as the **staging area** for all completed features and fixes before they are released to production.

---

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **Base for feature branches** — All new features (`feature/*`) are created from `develop`.  
- **Integration point** — Finished features are merged back into `develop`.  
- **Pre-release branch** — Contains the latest working code ready for testing before release.  
- **Stable but not production-ready** — The code should build and run correctly but may still require final QA.

---

## 🧭 Example Workflow

```bash
# Create a new feature branch from develop
git flow feature start login-system

# Work on the feature, then finish it (merges into develop)
git flow feature finish login-system

# Later, when preparing a release
git flow release start v1.0
```

After testing and preparing the release, the release branch is merged into both `main` (for production) and `develop` (to include any updates made during the release process).

The `develop` branch ensures a smooth workflow between development and production, keeping the `main` branch always clean and ready for deployment.
