# 🌿 The `feature` Branch in Git Flow

## Overview

In the **Git Flow** workflow, a `feature` branch is used to **develop new features, enhancements, or experimental code**.  
Each feature is isolated in its own branch to keep the `develop` branch clean and stable until the feature is completed.

---

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **Created from:** `develop`  
- **Merged back into:** `develop` when the feature is finished  
- **Purpose:** To work independently on a specific task or functionality  
- **Naming convention:** `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `feature/update-ui`)  
- **Temporary branch:** Deleted after merging back into `develop`  

---

## 🧭 Example Workflow

```bash
# Create a new feature branch from develop
git flow feature start add-login

# Work on the feature (commit changes, push if needed)
git add .
git commit -m "Add login functionality"
git flow feature publish add-login  # share with remote team members

# When the feature is done
git flow feature finish add-login
```

### Explanation of Commands

- `git flow feature start <feature-name>` → Creates a new branch `feature/<feature-name>` from `develop`.  
- `git flow feature publish <feature-name>` → Pushes the feature branch to the remote repository.  
- `git flow feature pull <remote> <feature-name>` → Pulls the feature branch from another developer.  
- `git flow feature finish <feature-name>` → Merges the feature into `develop` and deletes the local branch.

The `feature` branches help developers work in isolation without affecting the main codebase, ensuring smooth collaboration and clean integration.
